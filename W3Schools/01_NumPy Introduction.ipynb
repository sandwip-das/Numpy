    "## What is NumPy?\n",
    "NumPy was created in 2005 by merging two earlier numerical packages (Numeric and Numarray) to solve Python's shortcomings in numerical computing—specifically, efficient array handling and mathematical operations. Built largely in C for speed, it quickly became a critical, high-performance module in the scientific Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, NumPy is a cornerstone of the Python data ecosystem, providing the foundation for major data science and machine learning libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Its importance continues to grow with the rise of data science and AI, making mastery of NumPy essential.\n",
    "- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.\n",
    "- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.\n",
    "- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.\n",
    "- NumPy stands for Numerical Python."

    "## Why Use NumPy?\n",
    "- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.\n",
    "- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.\n",
    "- The array object in NumPy is called <mark>ndarray</mark>, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\n",
    "- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important."

    "## Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?\n",
    "- NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\n",

    "- This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures."
